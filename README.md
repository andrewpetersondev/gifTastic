# gifTastic

This project uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page populated with gifs. This project uses JavaScript and jQuery to call the GIPHY API and change the HTML of the site.

## Instructions (Completed)

* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

* Add a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.

* Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

## Bonus Goals (In Progress)

1. Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.

1. Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.

    1. Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.

1. List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

1. Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio

1. Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.

    1. This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.

1. If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).
