# gifTastic

## Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- AJAX
- Bootstrap 4
- Giphy API

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to practice working with APIs. This project uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page populated with gifs. This project uses JavaScript and jQuery to call the GIPHY API and change the HTML of the site.

## Instructions

- [x] When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

- [x] When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

- [x] Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

- [x] Add a form to the page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.

- [x] Deploy to Github Pages.

## Bonus Goals

- [ ] Ensure app is fully mobile responsive.

- [ ] Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.

  - [ ]Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.

- [ ] List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

- [ ] Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio

- [ ] Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.

  - [ ] This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.

- [ ] If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).

## Status

In Progress.
